# NFL-Yards-Prediction
# NFL is National Football League, a famous sport in United States. 
# Collected the Data from Kaggle.
# Initially Preprocessed using Python and used the final data to predict the Yards gained by a player after Handoff using R.
# Performed different Machine Learning algorithms like XGBOOST, Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso, PCA, PCR, PLS with and without tuning parameters.
# Using statistical analysis, compared the performances of all the models and observed that XGBoost(tuned) is the best model compared to others.
